## R Exercise

1. Create a function  called "count_func" that accepts two arguments, a string and a vector of string. It returns the count of the number of occurrences of the string in the input vector.
```{r 1. count_func}
count_func <- function(string, v){
  count = 0
  for (x in v) {
    if (x == string) {
      count = count + 1
    }
  }
  return (count)
}

#Example:
x = c("ML", "ML", "data", "data2")
count_func("ML", x)
```
